# The Appeal of Lift

This is code to accompany a series of blog posts at [programming.oreilly.com](http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/07/the-appeal-of-the-lift-web-frameworks.html).

To run this app:

    $ ./sbt

If this is the first time you've run this, it will download required libraries. When it has finished, at the SBT prompt (`>`), type:

    > container:start

...and visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/
